/**
 * In a pandemic, supermarkets are required to limit the number of customers in the store.
 * A way to achieve it is to provide a limited number of shopping baskets and require that
 * each customer entering the store has a shopping basket. When there are no more baskets,
 * an incoming customer has to wait for a previous customer to leave (and return their basket).
 *
 * This example demonstrates:
 *  - concurrency
 *    - customers come and shop concurrently
 *  - sequencing
 *    - a customer can shop only _after_ obtaining a basket
 *    - a customer can use an item only _after_ paying for it
 *    - ...
 *  - mutual exclusion
 *    - limited number of concurrently shopping customers
 *      - without side-effects on shared synchronization objects (such as semaphores)
 *  - linear & session types
 *    - obligation to return a basket enforced before execution
 *    - the type `Shopping` is a protocol between the store and the customer
